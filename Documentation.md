## Getting started with idea:
Our idea is to build an application which can be used to find the missing people.
## How we plan to approach the problem:
We are planning to build an application which can be used to find the missing people. Many times whenever we go to a crowded place like any fair, it happens that some child or old people goes missing. So, using our application missing people can be easily found. We are using face recognition to achieve this problem. So basically, if that missing person comes in contact with the camera the application will get notified and we can we will get to know about the missing person.
## Our Solution:
We have made an app which can be used to find missing person.  The best thing of this app is the process is very simple. To find any missing person just place the photo of that person in the database folder and run our application. As soon as the missing person comes in contact with the camera/CCTV our application with notify us by a sound and we can we will get to know about the missing person.

Our application is smart enough to detect the person even from side view.
